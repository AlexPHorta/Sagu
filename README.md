# SAGU

> My own static website generator.
> Because reinventing the wheel is fun!

The idea behind this project is just to let me drop some files in the `input` folder and the generator automatically sorts the generated html file in the corresponding folder. I won't have to open folders and place the files on the corresponding places. I'll just define an initial structure for the website, in the _paths.toml_ file, and the add the path tag in some meta information on each post.

## Dependencies

- Hatch (for development)
- Markdown
- Jinja2
